A low frequency oscillator or LFO is a concept/tool that is traditionally used in hardware as well as software sound synthesizes.
It's something I first saw used in [VVVV](https://vvvv.org/) as a tool for creating simple yet very organic animation.

The slow oscillation between values gives us an opportunity to introduce change gradually, and it can be used
in all sorts of interesting ways. In this sketch below we use an LFO to continuously alter the color, shape, and scale of our drawing.
